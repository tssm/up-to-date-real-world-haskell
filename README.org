Real World Haskell by Bryan O'Sullivan, Don Stewart and John
Goerzen is an old book (2008) that approach teaching Haskell by
building small programs. Sadly the language and libraries have
changed enough to make several of the examples useless so I am
making them working again. After I finish I pretend to make the
changes listed as /enhancements/ in the issue tracker.
